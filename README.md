## lab1: MapReduce

This lab is a simple implementation of the MapReduce algorithm in Go. It is a simple implementation of the algorithm that can be used to process large datasets in parallel. The program reads a file, splits it into chunks, and applies a function to each chunk in parallel. The function is typically a hash function that maps each chunk to a key-value pair. The key-value pairs are then sorted and reduced to a final result. The program can be run on a local machine or on a distributed system using a cluster of machines.
